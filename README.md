# Excel-Project---Bike-Sales

## What's Included? 
### Original Master File (Bike Sales)
Data set containing data for bike sales for a US bike shop.

### Bike Sales Portfolio Project
The aim of this project is to showcase advanced excel usage by: 

1. Cleaning the data
I have removed duplicates, used Find and Replace as well as IF and IF ELSE statements to clean the initial data set. 

2. Created Pivot tables and Excel Charts
The clean data is then used to create Pivot Tables where I can create relevant Excel Charts to further insights gained from the Data Sets

3. Interactive Dashboard
An example of an Excel Dashboard I have created which changes based on the parameters on the left of the dashboard.
